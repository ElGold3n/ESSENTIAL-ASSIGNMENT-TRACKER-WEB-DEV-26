This is a simple, personal Essential Assignment Tracker I built to help you stay organized during your university studies.

                                                  What it does

Shows upcoming Assignments and deadlines on the Home page

Lets you quickly add new Assignments with a name, due date, priority level, and optional notes.

Uses colored badges to highlight what’s urgent (Due Soon / Overdue)

Keeps everything lightweight — no login, no ads, just your clear-cut Assignments.


                                                    Main goal


Allows you to see at a glance what needs attention today or this week, so you don’t miss deadlines and can make better plans.

Lets you back up and export your assignment data as a JSON file, so you can use it offline or restore it on another device if your computer breaks.

                                      If I ever improve it, I’d like to add 

An interactive calendar view.

Customizable themes and colors.

Pop up window with confetti animation when all assignments are completed.

Optional Sound feedback with a sound toggle so that user can choose to have a sound play when they add an assignment or when an assignment becomes overdue.
